      <p class="lead">Mall Miles was a team challenge for our group members to design an app that would solve an everyday problem. This case study assignment was a collaboration between the four of us where we each split ideation, research, design and iterative processes evenly, and eventually came together to create a cohesive project as a team. We reached a mid-fidelity prototype of the app as our end goal.

        <p> It can be difficult to navigate certain Malls, depending on size and layout.  Add finding parking and standing in long lines at stores, and shopping can be a stressful experience.</p>

            <h1> the solution </h1>
   
        <p> Mall Miles was created as a virtual, on-the-go directory and navigation solution for users who both rarely visit the mall at all, as well as those who may consider themselves a mall rat. With Mall Miles, you are easily able to navigate to stores of your choice, while also being able to report and view long lines, parking situations, and busy areas - all while earning rewards!

<div class="container">

      <div class="col-sm">
            Our research found that people can be impatient, and can often become overwhelmed by shopping at the mall. They dislike having to find a confusing directory, and have low motivation to go shopping in person - especially after Covid-19.
​
            Knowing all of this, Mall Miles came into fruition.
            
            Mall Miles was designed to help all kinds of shoppers earn rewards while navigating any mall they choose.

            As user researchers, we wanted to understand how most mall shoppers find their desired stores, find whether peoples' parking situation correlates with the stores they'd like to visit, and learn how often both frequent shoppers and shoppers who don't visit the mall often feel about current mall directory situations.
​<br>
            We first created a proto persona who was designed to be an infrequent shopper with little experience on how to naviagte a mall. We conducted user interviews and asked questions such as, "What are some frustrations you face when shopping at the mall?". We then took our interview responses and formed user insight statements, as well as an official problem statement, created an empathy map, affinity diagram, and a user persona to represent the data we collected.

                Each team member individually created a hand drawn, low-fidelity wireframe based off of the user flow.

                <p>
                The wireframes were then converted into a clickable low-fidelity prototype.
                We each presented our wireframes within the team, demonstrating the functionality.
 
    
    Through this, we were able to make note of different layouts and design choices and usability.
    We decided on one low-fidelity prototype that best fit all of our ideas and user flows and tested it for usability. 
</p>
​
<p>
    Our insights from testing and watching users navigate our wireframe allowed us to make valuable changes to our mid-fidelity prototype

<h1>takeaways & the future</h1>
<p>We provided a unique solution by limiting our scope and niche to focus on a specific need of our users. We wanted to provide an app that helps to streamline the shopping experience, and ultimately make the shopping process fun in 2021
​
    The amount of time we had when completing the app was an obstacle in our process. We were also unable to test Mall Miles in an actual mall with real users because of covid related restrictions.
    
    We plan to continue to iterate on our design with further user testing. Our next phase of development would be to build out additional functionality including a QR function and additional functionality of the navigation and rewards portion of the app. We plan to further refine the UI elements and create a high-fidelity prototype.
