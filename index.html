      <p class="lead">Mall Miles was a team challenge for our group members to design an app that would solve an everyday problem. This case study assignment was a collaboration between the four of us where we each split ideation, research, design and iterative processes evenly, and eventually came together to create a cohesive project as a team. We reached a mid-fidelity prototype of the app as our end goal.

                <p> 
                  It can be difficult to navigate certain Malls, depending on size and layout.  Add finding parking and standing in long lines at stores, and shopping can be a stressful experience.

            <h1> The Solution </h1>
        <p> 
          Mall Miles was created as a virtual, on-the-go directory and navigation solution for users who both rarely visit the mall at all, as well as those who may consider themselves a mall rat. With Mall Miles, you are easily able to navigate to stores of your choice, while also being able to report and view long lines, parking situations, and busy areas - all while earning rewards!

<div class="container">

      <div class="col-sm">
            Our research found that people can be impatient, and can often become overwhelmed by shopping at the mall. They dislike having to find a confusing directory, and have low motivation to go shopping in person - especially after Covid-19.
​
            And that's how Mall Miles came to be.
            
            Mall Miles was designed to help all kinds of shoppers earn rewards while navigating any mall they choose.

            As user researchers, we wanted to understand how most mall shoppers find their desired stores, find whether peoples' parking situation correlates with the stores they'd like to visit, and learn how often both frequent shoppers and shoppers who don't visit the mall often feel about current mall directory situations.
​<br>
            We first created a proto persona who was designed to be an infrequent shopper with little experience on how to naviagte a mall. We conducted user interviews and asked questions such as, "What are some frustrations you face when shopping at the mall?". We then took our interview responses and formed user insight statements, as well as an official problem statement, created an empathy map, affinity diagram, and a user persona to represent the data we collected.

                  When it came to wireframing, each team member sketched out their low-fidelity vision of the app concept based off our user flow. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  These sketches were then digitalized to be a clickable low-fidelity prototype on invision, which we each presented to each other.
                  With this method, we were able to gauge each team members' visions, and choose the best ideas from each presentation to use for the mid-fidelity prototype.
                  We agreed on one low-fidelity prototype for the design, and took the best features and usability ideas from the rest to find the best fit for our final app concept. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  After administering our user tests on our clickable wireframe, we were able to make intuitive iterations to our mid-fidelity prototype.

              Our medium-fidelity prototype consisted of the best ideas and design decisions from each team member's individual low-fidelity prototype sketches, and iterations based off the user testing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This made for a variety of good ideas from each individual to be put together, and for the most appealing design and intuitive feature decisions.
            </p>   
            <p>
              We went through and notated each prototype on possible improvements for each. 
              Our iterations after collaborating on the changes we should make was the best way for us to put all four of our ideas together and create something we were all proud of.

<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
   <p> 
    The solution we provided was made to focus on a specific need our users expressed, and our main goal was to create an app that makes the shopping experience for all users more convenient and even fun. 
    An obstacle we encountered while creating Mall Miles was the time frame, as well as the existence of Covid-19. Behind every project is a creator who wishes there was more time to perfect it, and ultimately any amount of extra time would have been amazing, however we did the best we could with what we had in the moment. Because of the pandemic still in stages of limbo, as vaccine administration had just begun to ramp up, we were unable to meet up and try to test the app in a real mall with real shoppers.
    Our team hopes to continue to develop Mall Miles both in design and functionality, as we hoped to create a QR code feature which would be placed by each mall directory. Mall shoppers could scan  the code which would prompt them to download our app. This would create exposure as well as new users who could test the app out first hand. We also hope to work on our rewards system and flesh it out into reality, while always refining the user interface elements and keeping the design modern and up to date.
